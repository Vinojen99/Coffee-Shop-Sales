# Project 2: Coffee sales dashboard â˜•

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a Coffee Sales Dashboard to analyze sales, orders, and quantities for a coffee business. Using SQL for data preprocessing and Power BI for visualization, the dashboard provides a detailed overview of monthly performance trends. It enables stakeholders to track key metrics, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions to enhance business operations.

# Objective 
To create an intuitive dashboard that:
- Analyzes Total Sales: Tracks monthly sales trends, identifies increases or decreases, and compares selected monthjs with previous periods.
- Monitors Total Orders: Evaluates the number of monthly orders and highlights changes over time.
- Examines Quantity Sold: Reports total quantities sold per month, showcasing variations and growth patterns.

## Skills Demonstrated 
1. Data Analysis & SQL Querying
   - Aggregated and Calculated Sales Metrics: Used SQL to calculate total sales, total orders, and total quantites sold for each respective month.
   - Month-on-Month Comparisons: Implemented SQL queries to determine the month-on-month increase or decrease in sales, orders and quantities.
   - Performance Analysis: Created calculations to compare the selected month's data with the previous month, helping to identify sales trends and fluctuations.
2. Data Visualization in Power BI
   - Calendar Heat Map: Designed an interactive calendar heat map that dynamically adjusts based on user-selected months, color-coding each day according to sales volume.
   - Tooltips and Interactivity: Added tooltips to provide detailed sales, order, and quantity metrics when hovering over specific days or data points.
   - Sales Analysis by Weekdays vs. Weekends: Segmented and visualized sales data to compare weekday and weekend performance, offering insights into sales behavior.
3. Time-Series Analysis
   - Daily Sales Analysis: Created line charts to display daily sales for the selected month, incorporating an average sales line and highlighting exceptional sales days.
   - Sales Patterns by Hours and Days: Implemented heat maps to analyze and visualize sales patterns by hour and day, identifying peak times for sales and orders.
4. Comparative & Trend Analysis
   - Month-over-Month Sales Analysis: Developed visuals to track sales performance across multiple store locations, highlighting MoM differences for each store to identify growth or decline patterns.
   - Sales by Product Category: Analyzed and visualized sales performance across different product categories, helping to identify the most profitable categories.
   - Top Products by Sales: Displayed the top 10 best-performing products based on sales volume, providing insights into key products driving revenue.
5. Advanced Visualization Techniques
   - Heat Maps: Created multiple heat maps (calendar and hour-based) to provide rich, visual insights into sales performance across time.
   - Segmented Insights: Designed segmentation for analyzing sales across different time frames (weekdays, weekends, and hours), offering deep insights into business behavior.
6. Dashboard Interactivity & User Experience
   - Interactive Slicers: Incorporated slicers to allow users to select specific months and interact with the data in real-time.
   - Dynamic Tooltips: Enhanced user experience by implementing tooltips that show detailed metrics when hovering over elements, providing a more interactive and insightful dashboard.
