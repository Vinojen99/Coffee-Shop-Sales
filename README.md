# Project 2: Coffee sales dashboard â˜•

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a Coffee Sales Dashboard to analyze sales, orders, and quantities for a coffee business. Using SQL for data preprocessing and Power BI for visualization, the dashboard provides a detailed overview of monthly performance trends. It enables stakeholders to track key metrics, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions to enhance business operations.

# Objective 
To create an intuitive dashboard that:
- Analyzes Total Sales: Tracks monthly sales trends, identifies increases or decreases, and compares selected monthjs with previous periods.
- Monitors Total Orders: Evaluates the number of monthly orders and highlights changes over time.
- Examines Quantity Sold: Reports total quantities sold per month, showcasing variations and growth patterns.

## Skills Demonstrated 
1. Data Analysis & SQL Querying
   - Aggregated and Calculated Sales Metrics: Used SQL to calculate total sales, total orders, and total quantites sold for each respective month.
   - Month-on-Month Comparisons: Implemented SQL queries to determine the month-on-month increase or decrease in sales, orders and quantities.
   - Performance Analysis: Created calculations to compare the selected month's data with the previous month, helping to identify sales trends and fluctuations.
2. Data Visualization in Power BI
   - Calendar Heat Map: Designed an interactive calendar heat map that dynamically adjusts based on user-selected months, color-coding each day according to sales volume.
   - Tooltips and Interactivity: Added tooltips to provide detailed sales, order, and quantity metrics when hovering over specific days or data points.
   - Sales Analysis by Weekdays vs. Weekends: Segmented and visualized sales data to compare weekday and weekend performance, offering insights into sales behavior.
3. Time-Series Analysis
   - Daily Sales Analysis: Created line charts to display daily sales for the selected month, incorporating an average sales line and highlighting exceptional sales days.
   - Sales Patterns by Hours and Days: Implemented heat maps to analyze and visualize sales patterns by hour and day, identifying peak times for sales and orders.
